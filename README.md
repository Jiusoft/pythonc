# PythonC

PythonC is a Python Compiler which converts Python Files to Executables. It uses a different way of compiling from PyInstaller, which makes the Executable file not as large as the one that PyInstaller makes. It is not like you traditional compiler like gcc, though, you still need the Python 3 Interpreter. The only thing that it does is that it allows you to run your Python File with ./ and makes it not text. Currently only for Linux with sudo. 

## Advantages

- Run a Python file as ./ without python3 prefix. 
- Smaller file than the one that PyInstaller makes. 

## Disadvantages

- You still need Python 3 interpreter in order to run the Executable File.
